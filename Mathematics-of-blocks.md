We can think of a positive integer $n$ as a set of $n$ blocks arranged in a line--the same as marbles, dominoes, or any other countable objects.

Integers from 1 to 10:

```

oo

ooo

oooo

ooooo

oooooo

ooooooo

oooooooo

ooooooooo

oooooooooo
```

## Even and odd numbers

An even number can be divided into two equal parts, while an odd number cannot. Halving an odd number leaves a remainder of 1. An odd number has a "middle".[^1]

**Definition (Even and odd numbers)**: Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say that $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$.

## Notes

[^1]: Three blocks have a middle one; four don't. However, if three blocks form a triangle, we may not know which one is the middle. A set with an odd number of elements has a middle element if the elements are arranged in a line. It seems that such an ordering is said to be a _linear order_ (or a _total order_).
