We can think of a positive integer $n$ as a set of $n$ blocks arranged in a line--the same as marbles, dominoes, or any other countable objects.

Integers from 1 to 10:

## Even and odd numbers

**Definition (Even and odd numbers)**: Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say that $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$.
