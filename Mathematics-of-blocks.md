We can think of a positive integer $n$ as a set of $n$ blocks arranged in a line--the same as marbles, dominoes, or any other countable objects.

Integers from 1 to 10:

```
o

oo

ooo

oooo

ooooo

oooooo

ooooooo

oooooooo

ooooooooo

oooooooooo
```

## Even and odd numbers

An even number can be divided into two equal parts, while an odd number cannot. Halving an odd number leaves a remainder of 1. A set with an odd number of elements has a middle element.[^1]

**Definition (Even and odd numbers)**: Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say that $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$.

## Notes

[^1]: If the elements are not arranged in a line, we will not be able to determine the middle element. However, the elements of any finite set can be arranged in a line. It seems to be said that every finite set can be _linearly ordered_.
