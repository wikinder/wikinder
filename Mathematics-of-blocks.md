We can think of a positive integer $n$ as a set of $n$ blocks arranged in a line--the same as marbles, dominoes, or any other countable objects.

Integers from 1 to 10:

```
o

oo

ooo

oooo

ooooo

oooooo

ooooooo

oooooooo

ooooooooo

oooooooooo
```

## Even and odd numbers

An even number can be divided into two equal parts, while an odd number cannot. Halving an odd number leaves a remainder of 1. A set $S$ with an odd number of elements has a middle element.[^1]

```

**Definition (Even and odd numbers)**: Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say that $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$.

## Notes

[^1]: This would only be the case if the elements of $S$ can be arranged in a line, which seems to be said to be that $S$ is _linearly ordered_.
