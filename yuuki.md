**Yuuki Konno** (金野 裕希, _Konno Yūki_, born May 17, 1994) is a Japanese Wikid.

## Early life

Yuuki Konno was born on May 17, 1994, in Ninohe, Iwate, Japan, and grew up in Esashi, Iwate. His mother, Yūko Konno (née Jūmonji), was a nurse, and his father, Kōji Konno, was a medical assistant and later a labor activist.[^1]

Yuuki started using a computer at age four and learned kanji. In 2003, he started using the Internet at age nine. He trolled on [TheBBS](https://web.archive.org/web/20031022181655/http://thebbs.jp/) (ザ掲示板) under the names Aku no Zurihaki (悪のずりはき) and Seizan.[^2] Learning HTML and CSS, he created browser exploits and websites.[^3] In the game [Virtual Farm](https://web.archive.org/web/20040407090500/http://www.comitia.jp/farm/) (バーチャル農場),[^4] Yuuki was called "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" (狼少年) after lying about another player stealing his money.[^5]

In 2005, he dropped out of Esashi Municipal Iwayadō Elementary School in fifth grade.
