**Yuuki Konno** (金野 裕希, _Konno Yūki_; born May 17, 1994) is a Japanese Wikid.

## What I'm working on

### Recreational number theory

I study:

* Numbers like 111, 123, and 12321. Whether they are prime or not, etc.
* Elementary number theory using counting bears, like representing the number 3 as 🧸🧸🧸.
* The 24 game and the normal form of a numerical expression, like converting $8 + 2$ to $2 + 8.$

Keywords: repdigits, repunits, palindromic numbers, reverse of a number, concatenation of numbers
