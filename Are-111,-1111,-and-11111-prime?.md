I thought about this in the sauna at a hot spring:

Is 111 prime?

No, it is divisible by 3.

What about 1111?

This looks like a prime. It is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. But no. It has an amazing factorization: $1111 = 11 \times 101.$

What about 11111? Then I got overheated.

## Repunits

A number of the form 11...1 is called a _repunit_. Let $R_n$ be the repunit with $n$ ones. If $n$ is even, then $R_n$ is divisible by $R_2 = 11$ (e.g., $R_4 = 1111$ is divisible by $R_2 = 11$). In general, if $n$ is composite, then $R_n$ is divisible by $R_k,$ where $k$ is a factor of $n$ (e.g., $R_9 = 111,111,111$ is divisible by $R_3 = 111$).
