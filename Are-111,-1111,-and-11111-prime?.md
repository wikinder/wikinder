I thought about this in the sauna at a hot spring:

Is 111 prime?

No, it is divisible by 3.

What about 1111?

This looks like a prime. It is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. But no. It has an amazing factorization: $1111 = 11 \cdot 101.$

What about 11111? Then I got overheated.

## Repunits

A number of the form 11...1 is called a _repunit_. Let $R_n$ be the repunit with $n$ ones.

$R_4 = 1111$ is divisible by $R_2 = 11.$ If $n$ is even, then $R_n$ is divisible by $R_2 = 11.$

More generally, if $n$ is composite, then $R_n$ is divisible by $R_k,$ where $k$ is a factor of $n.$ For example, $R_9 = 111111111$ is divisible by $R_3 = 111.$

Therefore, if $R_n$ is prime, then $n$ is prime (but not vice versa).

$R_2 = 11$ is prime, but neither $R_3 = 111 = 3 \cdot 37$ nor $R_5 = 11111 = 41 \cdot 271$ is. Actually, the next primes after $R_2 = 11$ are $R_{19} = 1111111111111111111$ and $R_{23} = 11111111111111111111111,$ followed by $R_{317}.$
