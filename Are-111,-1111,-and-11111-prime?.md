I thought about this in the sauna at a hot spring:

Is 111 prime?

It is divisible by 3, so it is not prime.

So what about 1111?

This looks like prime. It is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. But no. It has an amazing factorization: $1111 = 11 \times 101.$ So this is also not prime.

What about 11111? Then I got overheated.
