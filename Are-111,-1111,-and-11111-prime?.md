I thought about this in the sauna at a hot spring:

Is 111 prime?

No, it is divisible by 3.

What about 1111?

This looks like a prime. It is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. But no. It has an amazing factorization: $1111 = 11 \times 101.$

What about 11111? Then I got overheated.

## Repunits

A number of the form 11...1 is called a _repunit_. Like 1111 is divisible by 11, if the number of 1s is even, it is divisible by 11. In general, if the number of 1s is composite, it is divisible by a repunit whose length is a factor. For example, $R_9 = 111111111$ is divisible by $R_3 = 111.$
